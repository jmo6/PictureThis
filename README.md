# PictureThis
Android application done for class as a group.
Uses the Google maps API and drops a pin to a location. The pin is saved to a database, Firebase, and all pins can be retrieved from main menu. Then pictures can be updated to that pin point location along with a description to the picture. Also all previously saved pictures to that location are shown as well. Saving pictures and pins are all done through Firebase.
